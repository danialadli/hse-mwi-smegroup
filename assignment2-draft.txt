Project Governance and Developer Onboarding System.
Starting Impact Set (SIS): The primary objects in this analysis are the CONTRIBUTING.md file 
and the technical documentation (API Overview) added to the repository. 

This component governs the interaction between new developers 
and the core MWI Data Pipeline (specifically the Metadata.xlsx and app.R files).


Graph Type: Traceability Graph (Horizontal Traceability).
Purpose: To illustrate the relationship between the requirement for 
standardized contributions and the implementation of documentation artifacts.
